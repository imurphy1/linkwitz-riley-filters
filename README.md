Spice implementation of Linkwitz-Riley Filters for active audio crossovers

These are based off the designs found on [Linkwitz Lab](https://www.linkwitzlab.com/filters.htm). These designs are intended to add active filtering to speaker systems, but could be useful for many other audio applications.

The spice models use a generic model of an opamp for each circuit and calculates ideal resistor values because it is meant to give quick results for initial design stages. In the future, there will be additional options to add in real world values for more realistic data.

Any issues, suggestions or development help is welcome
